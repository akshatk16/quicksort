# Quicksort Visualisation
A visulisation for **Quicksort Algorithm** using p5.js which sorts the random bars in non-decreasing order according to their height. Quicksort uses recursion and divides arrays into sub arrays to increase sorting speed. 

# Usage
- The algorithm starts itself when the page loads.
- Click **Randomize** to randomise the array and start over.

# What I learnt
- p5.js sketch and draw loop
- Sorting algorithms
- Recursion
- Array prototypes
- async functions
- Visualisation
